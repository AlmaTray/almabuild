## Title: Ashwalker Re-Buff

MODULE ID: ASHWALKER_BUFF

### Description:

Re-adds Ashwalker NV and Ash Immunity, also adjusts their damage resistances

When ashwalkers use regenerating cores on the tendril, it'll stablize the core.

When ashwalkers use laterns on the tendril, it'll corrupt them, making them not require a battery.

When a non-ashwalker touches the tendril with their bare hands when two ashwalkers are nearby, they will be prompted if they want to turn into an ashwalker.

Ashwalkers will now have the ability to change open turfs to basalt (lavaland) by using a shaman staff.
Obtainaing and maintaining it though will be the challenge.
Adds primal tools (surgery and engineering)
Adds some more ashwalker clothing

As a way to increase the agrarian life for ashwalkers, the ability to plant on lavaland is being introduced.
This will not be limited to ashies, but will be increased to non-ashies trying to plant
